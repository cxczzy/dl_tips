3) personal tips:
a) you MUST make sure that none of your HDD has not been formatted yet, or it may lead to that you cannot create /boot/efi when installing CentOS 7;
b) the commands which means to query the partition of your usb data-traveler are different between the situations that your HDDs are in MBR or GPT, please pay attention to this;
c) install command: "hd:/dev/sdXX nomodeset quiet" and the "nomodeset" MUST be added;
d) you MUST create /boot/efi when installing CentOS 7, ot it cannot be continued any more;
e) only partition /swap can be formatted as LVM, and the others are recommanded as standard.
