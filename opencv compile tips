1. opencv3.3.0 + cuda8.0 + vs2015
you need to compile opencv mannully because that opencv does not supply the cuda-version.
you can do this as https://blog.csdn.net/liujiabin076/article/details/68926699.
there are some tips:
1) please make sure your cuda8.0 and VS2015 have been installed correctly and you can see the CUDA build options in cmake;
2) check WITH_CUDA=ON
3ï¼‰check BUILD_PERF_TEST=OFF, or it may occur lots of compiling errors like: std::tuple<cv::Size,perf::`anonymous-namespace'::MatDepth
